# React app showing movies.

## It might take a while for Heroku server to start up.

- The app shows movies from OMDb API and my Flask Api. Made to practice React and learn React-Router.

Features:
- Own page for each searched/clicked movie.
- Search for movie function.
- Movies displayed on homepage/all/popular/new come from flask API hosted on Heroku.
