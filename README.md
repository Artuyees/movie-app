# React app showing movies.

## It might take a while for heroku server to start up.

- App that shows movies from OMDb API and my own Flask Api. Made to practice React and learn React-Router, uses base css as styling.

Features:

- Own page for each searched/clicked movie.
- Search for movie function.
- Movies displayed in homepage/all/popular/new come from flask api hosted on heroku.
